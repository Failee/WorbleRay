* consistent coding-style (whitespaces, inlining, references, clean up include...)
* perspective camera
* debug-utilities (including vector-printing)
* Phong-material
* plane-intersection
* directional light
* area light
* use float instead of double where appropriate
* copy-constructors, destructors
