# Implemented Features

* orthographic camera
* sphere intersection
* lambert material

# To Do

* handling Window-events
* consistent coding-style \
  (whitespaces, inlining, references, clean up includes, virtual destructors, for-each loops, rule of 3...)
* perspective camera
* debug-utilities (including vector-printing)
* Phong-material
* plane-intersection
* progressive raytracing for early feedback
* directional light
* area light
* use float instead of double where appropriate
* copy-constructors, destructors
* triangle-intersection and shading (flat, Gouraud, Phong)
* import meshes (and materials)
* antialiasing
* matrix- and normal-class as needed
* shadows (epsilon in intersections? See [Suffer:2014] sec. 3.4.1)
